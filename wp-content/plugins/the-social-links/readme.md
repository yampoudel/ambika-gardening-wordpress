# The Social Links

The Social Links plugin adds a widget and shortcode to your WordPress website allowing you to display icons linking to your social profiles. The new version includes the following social networks:

* Google+
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Linkedin

* Bitcoin
* Delicious
* DeviantArt

We've also added support for a **shortcode** (`[the-social-links]`) for use in WordPress posts and pages and a **custom template tag** (`<?php the_social_links();?>`) for use in template files.
